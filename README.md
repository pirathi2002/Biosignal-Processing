# Biosignal Processing Project

A complete MATLAB-based pipeline for biosignal processing, from raw data acquisition to machine learning classification.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive biosignal processing workflow that includes:
- Preprocessing techniques for artifact removal and noise reduction
- Feature extraction from multiple domains (time, frequency, time-frequency)
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Evaluation of multiple machine learning classifiers

The pipeline effectively handles common challenges in biosignal analysis, with SVM achieving the highest classification accuracy of 92%.
